## Football Hooligan Relations Analysis

The Football Hooligans Relation Analysis project aims to systematically gather and analyze data on the interactions, agreements, and conflicts among football hooligan groups in Poland and globally. 

By leveraging mathematical and data science research methods, the project will analyze current and past interactions to uncover patterns of behavior, motivations, and the social dynamics that drive these groups.
